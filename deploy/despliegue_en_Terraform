terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/azurerm from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/azurerm v4.26.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see  
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands  
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,      
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

terraform apply -var-file="secrets.tfvars"

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
